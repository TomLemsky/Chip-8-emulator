# Chip-8 emulator in pure JavaScript

An emulator for the CHIP-8 system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8

The CHIP-8 4x4 keypad is mapped to the keys "1234 qwer asdf yxcv"

The included ROMs are public domain from here: https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html

I wrote this to teach myself JavaScript, so there might be a better way to do stuff like timing, waiting for keypresses...
